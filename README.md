An expanding collection of free-to-use DIY impulse response files for convolvers.

## Sets
- **"Konsa"** – IR files from the Helsinki Conservatory of Music
  - Contains IR samples from the main concert hall, alongside with the hallways and staircases
  - Experimental files, some of which are at least somewhat usable
  - Recorded using a quality stereo condenser microphone. Unfortunately recorded only in 44.1kHz
  - The impulse sounds were made with party balloons. They were popped using a sharp needle.
