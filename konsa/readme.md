# "Konsa"

These files were recorded at the Helsinki Conservatory of Music (Helsingin konservatorio). The files are purely experimental, as the impulse was made using an exploding party balloon.

## Files
- AULA 1
  - From the end of the tall and long entrance hall
- AULA 2
  - Same as AULA 1, but the impulse was played further away
- CAFE 1
  - From the cafeteria, which is next to the entrance hall
- HALL 1
  - **Bit boxy.** From the concert hall.
- HALL 2
  - **Bit boxy.** From the concert hall.
- HALL 3 
  - Experimental stereo recording. The L-R-balance is not accurate; may sound a little weird.
- STAIRS 1â€“3
  - Probably the best files of the collection.
  - From the quieter tall staircase.
  - The first one has the impulse right in front of the mic, and it gets further away in the other files (directly above the mic)
